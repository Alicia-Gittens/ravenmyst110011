# Cybersecurity Job Listings ETL Pipeline

This project is a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts cybersecurity job listings from an API, processes the data to retrieve key job information, and saves the processed data to a CSV file using Pandas. The project demonstrates how to interact with an API, transform job data, and export it for further analysis.

## Features

- Extracts job listings data from the **RapidAPI Jobs API**.
- Processes job information such as skills, qualifications, responsibilities, experience, and job type (remote, on-site, full-time, contractor).
- Exports the processed job data into a CSV file for analysis or further processing.

## Technologies

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Requests**: To interact with the API.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and exporting to CSV.
- **Datetime**: To handle job posting timestamps.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

  #You will also need the following Python packages:
- `requests`
- `pandas`

  #To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
headers = {
    "x-rapidapi-key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "x-rapidapi-host": "jsearch.p.rapidapi.com"
}
python main.py
